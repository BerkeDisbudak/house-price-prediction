# House Prices Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a project to predict house prices using the **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset from Kaggle. The project leverages data preprocessing techniques, missing value imputation, and a Random Forest Regressor to achieve meaningful predictions. 

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" competition on Kaggle. I would like to extend my gratitude to Kaggle for providing this dataset and to all the contributors who shared their kernels and insights. Their work has been invaluable in guiding me as I learn and grow in the field of machine learning.

Special thanks to:
- Kaggle kernel contributors for their detailed and insightful solutions.
- Educators and mentors who have helped simplify complex concepts and inspired my learning journey.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle's competition:
[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

The dataset includes a variety of house features (both numerical and categorical) along with their sale prices. The goal is to predict the `SalePrice` of houses in the test set.

**Note:** The dataset files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) are not included in this repository due to licensing restrictions. Please download them directly from Kaggle and place them in the root directory of this project.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Loaded the training and test datasets using Pandas.
    - Filtered rows with missing `SalePrice` values (target column).
    - Selected numerical columns and excluded categorical features.
    - Handled missing values using median imputation.

2. **Model Training**:
    - Split the training data into training and validation sets (80%-20%).
    - Used a Random Forest Regressor to train the model.
    - Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

3. **Prediction**:
    - Applied the trained model to the test dataset.
    - Saved the predictions to a `submission.csv` file for submission to Kaggle.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/house-price-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the root directory.

5. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Results

The model achieved the following performance metrics:

- **Validation Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: `...` (to be filled with your actual results)

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

Install these libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
